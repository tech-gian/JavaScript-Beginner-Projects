# JavaScript-Beginner-Projects

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you will find some of my first JavaScript projects. I mostly used them to help me practice my knowledge. I gained a lot of beginner's experience through them and it really helped understand some basic principles for the web development, in general.

## Each Project

In each folder, you will find a separate project. So, each folder contains a .html file, a .css file and a .js file, for the structures, thier style and their functionality. In some projects needed, I have added some font-awesome icons or anything neccesary for the certain project (mainly for its style).

This repo is only some beginner's work. For more advanced projects, visit my ðŸ‘‰ [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/tech-gian).
